# Jenkins Pipelines
Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
- A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers. 
- Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes through a complex process on its way to being released. 
- This process involves building the software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as progressing the built software (called a "build") through multiple stages of testing and deployment.
- The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a `Jenkinsfile`) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository

The flowchart below is an example of one CD scenario easily modeled in Jenkins Pipeline

## Pipeline syntax overview
In Declarative Pipeline syntax, the pipeline block defines all the work done throughout your entire Pipeline.

```sh

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Fully automated and secured Terraform infra pipeline

![Jenkins Infra Setup](jenkins-learning.drawio.png)

## CICD Infra setup
1) ###### GitHub setup
    Fork GitHub Repository by using the existing repo "jenkins-terraform-infra-repo" (https://github.com/devopsmike-01/jenkins-terraform-infra-repo.git)     
    - Go to GitHub (github.com)
    - Login to your GitHub Account
    - Fork repository "jenkins-terraform-infra-repo" (https://github.com/devopsmike-01/jenkins-terraform-infra-repo.git) & name it "jenkins-terraform-infra-repo.git"
    - Clone your newly created repo to your local

2) ###### Jenkins
    - Create an **Amazon Linux 2 VM** instance and call it "Jenkins"
    - Instance type: t2.medium
    - Security Group (Open): 8080, 9100 and 22 to 0.0.0.0/0
    - Key pair: Select or create a new keypair
    - **Attach Jenkins server with IAM role having "AdministratorAccess"**
    - Launch Instance
    - After launching this Jenkins server, attach a tag as **Key=Application, value=jenkins**
    - SSH into the instance and Run the following commands in the **jenkins.sh** file found in the **installation-files** directory

### Jenkins setup
1) #### Access Jenkins
    Copy your Jenkins Public IP Address and paste on the browser = **ExternalIP:8080**
    - Login to your Jenkins instance using your Shell (GitBash or your Mac Terminal)
    - Copy the Path from the Jenkins UI to get the Administrator Password
        - Run: `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
        - Copy the password and login to Jenkins
    - Plugins: Choose Install Suggested Plugings 
    - Provide 
        - Username: **admin**
        - Password: **admin**
        - Name and Email can also be admin. You can use `admin` all, as its a poc.
    - Continue and Start using Jenkins

2)  #### Pipeline creation
    - Click on **New Item**
    - Enter an item name: **jenkins-cicd-pipeline** & select the category as **Pipeline**
    - Now scroll-down and in the Pipeline section --> Definition --> Select Pipeline script from SCM
    - SCM: **Git**
    - Repositories
        - Repository URL: FILL YOUR OWN REPO URL (that we created by importing in the first step)
        - Branch Specifier (blank for 'any'): */main
        - Script Path: Jenkinsfile
    - Save

3)  #### Plugin installations:
    - Click on "Manage Jenkins"
    - Click on "Plugin Manager"
    - Click "Available"
    - Search and Install the following Plugings "Install Without Restart"        
        - **Terraform**

4)  #### Credentials setup(AWS):
    - Click on Manage Jenkins --> Manage Credentials --> Global credentials (unrestricted) --> Add Credentials
        1)  ###### AWS Credential (AWS_ACCESS_KEY)
            - Kind: Secret text            
            - Secret: lXpiMy7yGJLm9V6OsMmdkKVS
            - ID: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
            - Description: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
            - Click on Create    
        2) ###### AWS Credential (AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
            - Kind: Secret text            
            - Secret: lXpiMy7yGJLm9V6OsMmdkKVS
            - ID: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            - Description: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            - Click on Create              


### Performing continous integration with GitHub webhook

1) #### Add jenkins webhook to github
    - Access your repo **jenkins_with_terraform_deployment** on github
    - Goto Settings --> Webhooks --> Click on Add webhook 
    - Payload URL: **htpp://REPLACE-JENKINS-SERVER-PUBLIC-IP:8080/github-webhook/**    (Note: The IP should be public as GitHub is outside of the AWS VPC where Jenkins server is hosted)
    - Click on Add webhook

2) #### Configure on the Jenkins side to pull based on the event
    - Access your jenkins server, pipeline **jenkins-cicd-pipeline**
    - Once pipeline is accessed --> Click on Configure --> In the General section --> **Select GitHub project checkbox** and fill your repo URL of the project.
    - Scroll down --> In the Build Triggers section -->  **Select GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling checkbox**

Once both the above steps are done click on Save.


### Codebase setup

1) #### For checking the Gitbut webhook uncomment lines 18-24 in main.tf file
    - Go back to your local, open your "jenkins-cicd-repo" project on VSCODE
    - Open "main.tf file" uncomment lines   
    - Save the changes in both files
    - Finally push changes to repo
        `git add .`
        `git commit -m "relevant commit message"`
        `git push`
### Finally observe the whole flow and understand the integrations
