# Jenkins Pipelines
Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
- A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers. 
- Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes through a complex process on its way to being released. 
- This process involves building the software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as progressing the built software (called a "build") through multiple stages of testing and deployment.
- The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a `Jenkinsfile`) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository

The flowchart below is an example of one CD scenario easily modeled in Jenkins Pipeline

## Pipeline syntax overview
In Declarative Pipeline syntax, the pipeline block defines all the work done throughout your entire Pipeline.

```sh

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Once both the above steps are done click on Save.


### Codebase setup

1) #### For checking the Gitbut webhook uncomment lines 18-24 in main.tf file
    - Go back to your local, open your "wandaprep-tf-infra-repo" project on VSCODE
    - Open "main.tf file" uncomment lines   
    - Save the changes in both files
    - Finally push changes to repo
        `git add .`
        `git commit -m "relevant commit message"`
        `git push`
### Finally observe the whole flow and understand the integrations
